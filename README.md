<h1>Cisco Packet Tracer Notes</h1>

<p>
This website is an amalgamation of everything I understand about the Cisco IOS. It contains configuration for many network devices, including routers, switches, the Cisco ASA, and more. Hopefully, this will help future people learn Packet Tracer more effectively without investing thousands of hours like I did.

Enjoy!
